# BeThrifty
A school project for hosting an application for the company BeThrifty.

### Situation
The company does not have any ready-made warehouse software. Excel lists are used for the internal evaluation of stock levels using the Google G-Suit. The cumbersome operation of the G-Suit leads to loss of time and prevents an improvement in the workflow.
