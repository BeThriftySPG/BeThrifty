# BeThriftySPG
A school project for hosting an application for the company BeThrifty.

### Situation
The company does not have any ready-made warehouse software. Excel lists are used for the internal evaluation of stock levels using the Google G-Suit. The cumbersome operation of the G-Suit leads to loss of time and prevents an improvement in the workflow.

### Solution
Writing a web-based application for managing events and stocks. With extra features like user-roles and login and visual graphics like diagrams and tables for better overview.

### Integrated technologies
- Microsoft MVC as backend API
- MongoDB as the underlying database technology
- HTML and JavaScript as frontend
- DataTables as library for displaying asynchronous compatible HTML tables
- Apache ECharts for rendering diagrams and graphs in HTML5

### Project Team
- Ritter as project team leader and database designer
- Sperlich as frontend coder
- Weichselbaum as frontend designer
- Wei√ünegger as programmer for the backend MVC-API
